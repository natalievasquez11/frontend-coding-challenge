# Jane Technologies - Frontend Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to complete this coding challenge for Jane Technologies! This is a chance for you to demonstrate your skills, talents, and abilities on your own terms, with some high-level requirements provided to guide the way.

## What You’ll Do

We would like you to build a basic cannabis e-commerce web application with React.js. This application will provide the customer with the ability to search for products, add them to a cart, and remove from a cart. We will provide a client to access the mock backend API. With the relatively short amount of time allotted for the exercise, we realize that some concessions will need to be made in design decisions. Have fun, do your best, and we can’t wait to see what you build.

## Requirements

- We want to respect your time, and as such please limit this assignment to a maximum of 2 hours development.
- Product data must be retrieved using the provided `fetchProducts` function located in `./src/client.ts`
- The customer should be presented with a list of products.
- The customer should be able to search through the list of products, and filter results by `name` and `description`
- When a customer types in a search box some text, the product results should filter to display only items with a name or description matching that text.
- The customer needs the ability to add a product to their cart
- The customer needs the ability to remove a product from their cart
- The application needs some level of test coverage. We will provide a script that covers which areas should be tested in `./src/App.test.tsx`
- All tests written should pass when running `npm run test`
- The application must be able to be served locally using `npm run start`

## Evaluation Points

Your assignment will be evaluated based on performance in each of the technical following areas:

- Semantic & Well-formed HTML
- Well-formed and clean CSS
- Test Coverage
- Component Architecture
- State Management (where appropriate)
- TypeScript & Typings (Bonus Points)

## Technical Notes

- This repository was generated using `create-react-app`
- You are free to install any third-party dependencies that you wish.
- You are welcome to install a component library or to use a third-party css framework. The look and feel of the application is completely up to you.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
